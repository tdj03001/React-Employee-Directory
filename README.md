# React-Employee-Directory


## Purpose

The employee directory is an app that allows employers and team members to view basic insensitive data about other employees such as name, photo, and contact information. It is a light weight app for quick reference to employee profiles with the goal of unifying this information in a single, easy to use repository.

## Usage

The site starts with a full list of employees (random data from internet. Our clients would provide actual employee data) which the user can sort by column headers and filter using the search box.

Users click column headers one time to sort the list by that column in ascending order. Clicking the column header a second time will reverse the sort to descending order. A third click will reset to the originally rendered order.

Users can also start entering text into the input field and the app will auto-filter to matching results without having to click a button or 'enter.'
