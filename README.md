# React-Employee-Directory


# Purpose

The employee directory is an app that allows employers and team members to view basic insensitive data about other employees such as name, photo, and contact information. It is a light weight app for quick reference to employee profiles with the goal of unifying this information in a single, easy to use repository.

# Usage

The site starts with a full list of employees which the user can sort by column headers and filter using the search box.
